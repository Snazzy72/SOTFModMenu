# SOTFModMenu
Mod Menu for Sons Of The Forest

## Status
Currently still a WIP. I will be working on this project whenever I get time. I will keep the repo visibility as public throughout development, to allow you to make use of any source code as it's posted, should you need it.

## Features
The end goal is to obviously modify all in game items, vitals, stats, game states etc..

* Max Health
* Max Stamina
* Max Strength
* Infinite Logs
* Instant Build
* Infinite Ammo
* Add items to inventory
* etc...

At the time of writing the README, the only implemented feature is `Item Spawner` - Add any item to inventory, with custom amount

## Installation:

* This plugin makes use of the BepInEx IL2CPP Framework to load the plugin, therefore, `BepInEx` will be required.

1. Download [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/sons-of-the-forest/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_IL2CPP/)
2. Drag contents of the `BepInExPack` file into Sons of the Forest game directory (right click in steam > browse local files)
3. Download SOTFModMenu.dll and drag it into BepInEx/plugins

* Run the game. If everything runs correctly, you will see BepInEx console pop up on your desktop

Step 3 is not yet available. I will create a release once I have implemented a few more features. Feel free to look into the source code and build your own DLL from it if you'd like to use it immediately.
